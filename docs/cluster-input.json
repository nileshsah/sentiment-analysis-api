The computer is very responsive and the keyboard is slick and good feeling #No Homo :) LOL . Overall i do give it a 9/10  because it has a intergrated GPU. The GPU goes up to 2gb thats good but sometimes it fails and goes to 512mb of video memory",

      "Author": "rsd",
      "ReviewID": "R3LGERG2YJU60S",
      "Overall": "2.0",
      "Content": "We needed a new laptop, one that could withstand the wear and tear of everyday use in the home.  I needed this laptop for internet, email, basic Office functionality (primarily Excel and Word, occasionally Ppt), Itunes music interface with ipod, and we needed the HDMI port so we could stream to our tv.  We made the mistake of ordering this system with Win 8 instead of 7.  I can't say how much better the system would've functioned with 7, but I know it is barely operable with Win 8. Both Microsoft and HP should be ashamed that their product created such a perfect storm of frustration and crappy functioning.WIn 8 sucks.  Everyone knows it.  Everyone but MS employees will readily say so.  So I'm not going to waste a ton of time detailing why it's an extremely bad idea to put an OS designed for a touch screen on a lap top that does not have a touch screen.Let's talk updates.  When I configured Win 8 I clicked the setting that Win 8 is NOT allowed to install any updates without asking me first. I do not like too much running in the background without my knowledge.  So what happens?  LIKE AN ABUSIVE BOYFRIEND, WIN 8 will ask if I want to update and soon after I say \"no\", not yet,  MY MOUSE POINTER MAGICALLY FREEZES AND FUNCTIONALITY SLOWS TO A CRAWL as my system has a seizure.  I once waited 1/2 an hour for this to remedy itself.  It did not. Several times, my indicator for Norton Internet Security suddenly goes away or shows up as being deactivated (WTF?).  I was forced to alt+ctrl+del and restart. During shutdown, Windows suddenly decides that it's ok to begin installing that update that I previously turned down.  HOW FRIGGING CONVENIENT!  This happens EVERY DAMN UPDATE!HP isn't innocent either.  The HP support assistant is supposed to be a friendly interface there to let you know of updates that are ready, fixes you need, even basic maintenance suggestions (like a recovery set).  And it would probably be lovely if the damn thing didn't a) choke up all application functioning once a week when its dialog box pops on the scene to let me know what's up (weekly notification, you can't set it for longer terms), b) takes a full minute to open, and c) crashes itself 50% of the time during updates.This machine doesn't like to go to sleep and frequently goes into a mini-coma when you try to wake it up.  And god help you if you close the laptop, change your mind, and immediately try to open it again.  The screen will be off and you're going to be there for at least another 10 minutes waiting for the system to fully turn itself off and go to sleep, and then you have to wake it from its mini coma (a feat in and of itself) before you can get any kind of functionality back.Software and applications on the system take an extremely long (and unacceptable) amount of time to open, they periodically freeze up, and frequently crash.  Thanks to Win 8 itself the OS is very resistant to change and pulls out all the stops to prevent you from properly using other vendors' applications. -However, once you manage to get those apps installed, they work so much better that what comes on this piece of junk (thank you to Itunes, Foxit, and Outlook in particular).The inherent applications put on here to open files (Windows Media player, Mail, Live, etc), take forever to open and frequently need massaging to work.  -Yes, I remedied this by putting on my own applications that work better, but it took forever because Win 8 doesn't want you to change a thing.  It took forever for me to even dig up the right files in Win explorer to take out the crap I didn't want (and there is so very much crap loaded on here).All of these problems were there from day 1.  They can't be blamed on viruses or incompatible/competing software or me screwing with it.  Day frigging 1.  I was the fool who thought all systems had their problems and I could find fixes for these.  It's been a year and just as I solve one issue, another one opens.  My spouse has a mac in the den and can't even stand to use this laptop for anything at all.OH, and whatever you do, don't use Norton Internet Security on this machine.  Even though that's the free trial you get with the system, it practically destroys functionality in and of itself.  If you set it to do anything at all on your system (even the least invasive), it becomes a massive resource hog and can often shut down functionality itself.So this laptop + Win 8 + Norton = A really bad time.  You're signing on for an abusive relationship and lots of disappointment.Why did I give 2 stars instead of 1.  Very simple:  A) the HDMI port works as advertised and actually does send images to my tv beautifully (when I can get my streaming working that is), and B) I can honestly say that because of my experiences with this system my standards have dropped so incredibly low that as soon as I get my new laptop (which won't be HP or Win 8) I am going to be delighted into ecstasy.",

The computer starts to slow down and it's definitely not worth the money.About a 6 months ago, white lines started to appear on my monitor and they started to appear right after my warranty ended.This computer disappointed me. There is no way to fix it unless you spend $300 or more. I'd recommend that you spend a little more money and get a more reliable laptop than this.",

It gets the job done everyday for a student like me but I do have some problems with this computer:- It's starting to get slow- The touchpad doesn't always respond-It freezes sometimes for no reason- Lastly windows 8 is slow at times-May be harder to use for some people who aren't tech savvy- Could have better speakersPROS:- Windows 8 is smooth to use- Computer response time is fast- Easier layout- More customization options-Good Battery LifeI love windows 8 though because everything is very organized on a different type of start menu. The layout is great even though sometimes my friends and teachers don't know how to use it. It didn't take me that long to get adjusted. I believe that this is a great computer overall, but I'm sure that there are much better computers out there than this one. I'm just glad that I was able to find a good computer for under $300 on my highschool budget.",

There is NO Start menu anymore, its more like lets try and find where everything is at. The computer its self, I really like. Has a few glitches but what computer don't? Battery is pretty good on this computer. Love the color, very pretty blue. If this computer was running a Windows 7, would be 5 stars, but I just can't wrap my hands around the windows 8, and I'm usually really good at technology... but without touch screen the apps seem pointless... I would recommended if your ok with Windows 8, or don't mind the challenge of trying to find everything again... Also, I want to note that the mouse pad is RUFF, so it takes awhile to get used to! it's not soft like normal ones, its got bumps so feels extremely weird at first.. took me about a week to get used to the feeling...",

Due to my lack of Funds my Mother surprised me with this Laptop (Which shes still eating PB&J; today to make up for the Costs) Its Cheap but its still $300.00 out of pocket my Mother paid.LIKES: When it comes to using the Web Cam to talk to my Sister.. ITS AMAZING!!! This is BIG for me. Even in the dim light it you can see everything perfectly. Beyond my expectations.The Detail & Coloring on the Screen look very good as well as the Exterior. When I opened it, I wouldn't have guessed it was only $300.00. What a Gorgeous Laptop!!DISLIKES: The amount of time it freezes up is ridiculous... After a while it gets very irritating.I type fast & When writing my sister or anyone on Facebook, I cant see what im writing until I send it.Also.. The Skype App was already downloaded to my Windows 8.. But it was sooo difficult I couldn't use it. Wouldn't let me sign in or \"update\" it. So I had to download Skype to my Desktop. My curser takes a while to move sometimes which also goes along with the freezing up & Windows 8 is difficult to use or understand.Ive only used the Laptop a Week & Understand its not Top Notch Quality but I recommend someone to do their research before buying. Will update later after using the Laptop for longer.",

      "Content": "UPDATE:  11/27/13 =  After writing this review HP contacted me and ended up offering to fix my laptop!  The problem is there were no parts for my model any more.  So they REPLACED MY LAPTOP!  NO charge!  I could not be happier with HP customer service!I would still photograph all sides of any product I would send in the mail (with a current newspaper to show the date sent) just in case it gets broken outside of your control.THANKS HP!  (To repeat: I did not buy this particular item.)Original review:  BE FOREWARNED:  HP SERVICE / WARRANTY IS NOT RELIABLE!!!The story:  I have an HP laptop which I sent in for warranty checkup (fix some rubber screen bumpers, cleaning, fan noise, etc.)  On the way there or at HP, it got damaged, which they claim was my doing and wanted $128 to fix it!  They were nice saying that was a \u00bd price offer!  But THEY caused the damage to the laptop!?  The reps said, \"Do you have pictures of the laptop?\"  Ha!  So when I refused to pay and it was returned, it would not even turn on!  I had a professional engineer open it and he said it must have been violently dropped as the CPU had come unseated.  Also they cracked the hinge on one side, so I couldn't close the lid w/o snapping the screen off.  I wrote a letter to the head of marketing and his assistant called back.  He offered me a nominal amount to trade up to another new laptop.  I declined as it wasn't a reasonable offer.  So be forewarned:  IF you get an HP product, the repair dept. may break it and the company will NOT fix it.  They will blame you.  IF you do send it in for repair, take a dozen photos from every angle as you'd have some proof.  I'd take a picture of the box just before you send it as well.  I have had 2 laptops, a camera, and printers from HP.  Never again.  I also sold my shares of HP stock!  BUYER BEWARE!  WORST CUSTOMER SERVICE EXPERIENCE EVER! p.s.  I did not purchase this laptop.",

If you're just looking to surf the web, this might be fine, but if you're looking to do anything technical or anything that requires speed, this isn't the laptop for you.  You may ask, who would this laptop be good for? Answer: Grandma and Grandpa who only check email and occasional web surfing and have plenty of waiting time on their hands.All in all, if you don't mind waiting for things to load, you'd be fine, but trust me, I would spend $400-$500 before I'd buy this laptop again.

Unless you plan on performing the most basic tasks (sending email, etc...) then this laptop is worthless. I've also noticed some of the strange behavior that other posters have commented on such as: inexplicably switching to windows 8 tiles mode or just generally acting very buggy. There is something seriously deceiving about the quality represented with this laptop. You get what you pay for. I will be returning it tomorrow.",

I understand the limitations of this machine and I bought it thinking that word processing and web browsing were my major computing activities.  However, compared to other laptops, this model is slow at every task.  So slow that tech support acknowledged it, even with constant firmware and bios updates.  I added 8GB of RAM(removed the stock 2GB--8GB is max, which limits its future potential) and the speed improved enough to be useful at school but it is embarrassing slow.  The fan is not loud, but it is noticeable.  The keyboard is slippery and the mouse is too sensitive--but you'll get over these things.  Web browsing (any browser) is slower than my iMac and any of the PC's at school.  It's enough to get basic jobs done but the speed is frustratingly slow.  In hindsight, impulse buying this laptop was not a good decision for me because I had to spend almost another $40 for RAM.  I recommend checking out dealnews.com, dealigg.com, newegg.com woot.com or any price comparison website before buying this laptop.",

I used to own a Toshiba laptop with a 2.0 GHz processor speed but it does not produce what this laptop gives with only 1.3GHz. Plus it has a fair price.  As of now my laptop is still running smoothly. I would recommend buying it.",

I wouldn't recommend this to anyone, but each has his own way of working things as well as likes and dislikes.. Good-luck!",

      "Content": "If I could choose a negative 8, I would have used it. I've had this computer 6 terrible weeks and now it is in a repair shop.  I don't know if it's just the software or also the hardware.  But I've already had to replace the card reader driver, which took me and two different Indians, with different plans for the fix about 6 hours to get it fixed. The computer lost the first guy somehow which necessitated the second one. At least he noticed that the first had had me add some new software which he removed and added it back automatically, or I would have been working several more hours.And Windows 8, - where to start - it takes a few more clicks to just turn it off and I still can't find a way to close down open windows. resolution is always in a flux - getting bigger until most everything is off the screen or going down to microscopic level.  I think my blood pressure has gone up 20 points, just trying to deal with ordinary everyday, supposedly automatic uses of the computer.So I'm not impressed with the computer and really can't stand Windows 8.  It seems like a giant advertising tool and I'm still trying to get their backup company to leave me alone.",
